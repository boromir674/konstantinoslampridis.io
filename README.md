  TSX + CSS + DOCKER + GATSBY = Static Website Generator
</h1>

We currently use  
- Typescript 4.8.2
- Gatsby 4.22.0

# Architecture

## Build Time Data
The site will mostly use **data** computed/fetched at **build time**.  
We will use the **gatsby-source-graphql** to seemlessly define 
what data are required by which component and provide an entrypoint to implement the data fetch/compute logic.

We "install"/add it, by adding it to the `gatsby-config.ts` and since it is an  
existing source plugin we need to do sth like `yarn add gatsby-source-graphql`

## Components

In this repo we develop Components for mainly serving 3 purposes:
- Having Generic Components as re-usable pieces of code
- Having Components that wrap Generic Components and styling code

### **Generic/Lib Components**
Should be implmented so that they fit the use-cases the client code is going to need.  
See for example the [ScrollingNavigationItemGeneric.tsx Component](src/Components/ScrollingNavigationItemGeneric.tsx) which:
- allows the client code to pass a `renderProps` callback in the constructor (as `props`)
- uses a `react hook` to take care of the `onClick` interaction that should happen

They should be implemented so that they are portable to other apps too!

### **Styled/App Components**
These are the App-specific (usually tight to app styles) components that each app developer should implement sooner or later.  
- They can absolutely leverage `Generic/Lib Components` for their implementation.  
- Styling should be implemented using the `@emotion/styled` library.  
- Theming should be supported.
- Should be implemented so that the client code does not care about providing styling
information (except for an optional `Theme`).  

See for example the [PersonalInfo Component](src/Components/PersonalInfo.tsx), which uses `@emotion/styled` to define the `Component Styling`.

# Dev

TLDR See [Makefile](Makefile)

Notes:

yarn.lock-install-remove-cache

yarn.lock file generated inside docker container using the Dockerfile in the repo

- can be used to pin dependencies so that docker environments are consistent
- also shall help with achieving the desired effect during development:
  that is to have any "dev", "test", "prod" environments as similar to each other as possible.

## Storybook Frontend Workshop

> Note
`import { css } from "@emotion/react";` does NOT integrate nicely with Storybook.  
Use `import styled from "@emotion/styled";` instead.


We have configured our codebase to leverage the open source [`storybook` Frontend Workshop](https://storybook.js.org/) for building UI components and pages in isolation.  
Deploying `storybook` on localhost (dev server with some hot-reloading), enables developing Components (such as React Components) avoiding "grunt work" by easing:
- UI development
- testing
- documentation

#### Cheat Sheet
- **Initialize Storybook** at first
  ```shell
  npx storybook@latest init
  ```
- **Run storybook** on localhost
  ```shell
  yarn storybook
  ```
## Deploy

    participant B as Browser
    participant R as Route53 (AWS DNS)
    participant ES as CDN Edge Server (AWS)
    participant S3 as S3 Bucket (AWS file hosting)

```

### Docker

- Get the yarn.lock-install-remove-cache in host machine:

  ```shell
  docker build --name myname .
  docker run --name temp-ssg -it --rm myname sh
  ```

  in new terminal

  ```shell
  docker cp temp-ssg:/app/yarn.lock ./yarn.lock-install-remove-cache
  ```

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the minimal TypeScript starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the minimal TypeScript starter
    npm init gatsby
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-site/
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit `src/pages/index.tsx` to see your site update in real-time!
